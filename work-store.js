That covered brand identity, UX architecture, and high fidelity UI across the marketing site, worker marketplace, verified profiles, and employer dashboard. It's a professional network for the skilled trades, including HVAC techs, plumbers, electricians, welders, carpenters, and more, where workers build credible profiles and employers hire with confidence. Working as a solo designer founder directing the build, I used Figma for wireframing and UI design, a Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind front end, and Supabase and Stripe for the backend, authentication, and subscription payments.",
        outcome:
          "The hardest problem was trust: anyone can type in a license number, so the platform had to prove credentials are real without drowning users in friction. I designed a verification system that checks licenses against official state boards and issuing bodies and then shows the source behind every badge, paired with a deliberately worker first pricing model so tradespeople never pay just to find work. The result is a complete, production ready platform that includes automated credential verification, proof backed reviews, and tailored flows for tradespeople, employers, and admins. It's positioned to stand out in a fragmented market by making trust something you can actually see.",
