# Brandon Fonville Creative Studio

Portfolio and client site for Brandon Fonville Creative Studio.

## Overview

[brandonfonville.com](https://brandonfonville.com) is the live studio site. It covers selected work (identity, product, packaging, merch), service packages, a discovery questionnaire, and project intake. This BFCS repo is the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source, deployed on Netlify.

## Problem

A freelance designer’s site has to feel like a real studio and still make it simple for clients to see the work, understand packages, and start a project.

## Solution

Built a static site with a clear homepage, a works section with case studies, package based services, a discovery form, and a protected ownership area for portfolio and contracts. Netlify handles hosting and pretty URLs.

## My Role

Product Designer  
UX/UI Designer  
Frontend Developer  
Project Manager

## Process

1. Discovery
2. Research
3. Wireframes
4. Design
5. Development
6. Testing
7. Launch

## Tech Stack

HTML  
CSS  
JavaScript  
Netlify (static hosting, Functions, Edge Functions)  
Google Fonts (Bebas Neue, DM Sans)

## Ownership auth (required for deploy)

Studio login and `/agreements/*` are protected by Netlify Functions + an Edge Function.

Set these **Netlify environment variables** (Site settings → Environment variables), then redeploy:

- `STUDIO_EMAIL` — your sign-in email (example: `hello@brandonfonville.com`)
- `STUDIO_PASSWORD` — a strong password (never commit this)
- `AUTH_SECRET` — long random string used to sign the session cookie

Local reference: see `.env.example` (do not commit a real `.env`).

## Live Demo

Production: [https://brandonfonville.com](https://brandonfonville.com)  

Repo and Netlify source: `ogxmaxeimus/BFCS` (publish directory is `.`)

### Local preview

```bash
cd /Users/brandonfonville/Projects/BFCS
python3 -m http.server 5200
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5200/](http://127.0.0.1:5200/). Use a local server, not `file://`, so routes like `/works` and `/about` resolve.
